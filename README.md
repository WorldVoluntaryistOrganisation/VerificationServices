# Verification Services

Verification Services approved by the [World Voluntaryist Organisation](https://www.worldvoluntaryist.org/).

Software should use the [services.json](services.json) file to retrieve the always up-to-date decentralized identifier (DID) of all the approved Verification Services.

The DIDs are used to verify the authenticity of individually issued FreeID credentials.
